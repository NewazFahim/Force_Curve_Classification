# Force_Curve_Classification
Nanoendoscopy is an outstanding technique of AFM(Atomic Force Microscopy) to charachterize from soft materials like cells to mataerials like carbon nanotubes. Its providing most vital role and valuable insight in the live cell imaging. 
As the tchniques is very sophisticated, the generated data by this techniques are also very complicated. Hence, the analysis of the data needs expertise and the methods are very time consuming. A huge human efforts are needed to interpret the data.
On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is making the data analysis precedure much more easier even the data structure is whatever complicated. If there is a bridge between the AFM Data analysis and AI, the efforts of human can be reduced and time saving strategy can be created.
This project is the example of one of that bridge.
